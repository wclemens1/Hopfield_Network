# Hopfield Network

A Hopfield network is a somewhat ancient form of neural network who's capabilities have been long surpassed by more modern algorithms. However they have been considered more recently in the context of quantum computing, see https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.7005. The neurons in a Hopfield network take only binary values, usually represented as 1 and -1, which would lend itself to quantum computing much more easily than the more complex activations in modern neural networks. The similarity to the Ising model commonly used in physics also makes this familiar to me.

In a quantum neural network the neurons would be premoted to, bizarrely named even by physics standards, "qurons" which can exist in a superposition of both possible states.

I'm somewhat skeptical about quantum computers being powerful enough to run anything like a neural network in a reasonable amount of time. But still the review above was fun to read and my background in string theory gives me a fairly high tolerance for science fiction.

Unfortunately I haven't got my quantum computer with me right now so I'll just implement this classically for now. As well as practice some object oriented programming while I'm at it.
